        <img scr="vip.jfif" style="float: right;">
           <h3>Raghuvaran is a graduate in Civil Engineering, but has been unemployed for four years. He is adamant about working in a job <br>related to his field only and is unwilling to accept any other profession. He often comes into conflict with his father, who<br>considers him irresponsible. His younger brother, Karthik, works in an IT company, earning well and, evidently, his father's<br>approval. Raghuvaran's mother, Bhuvana, however, supports him. Raghuvaran falls for his neighbour's daughter, Shalini who<br>hates him initially, but warms up to him after hearing about the difficulties he is facing and eventually reciprocates his love.<br></h3>

           <h3>One day, while Raghuvaran's father and Karthik are absent, he is asked to look after his mother, who has a heart condition. <br> However, he goes out on a date with Shalini. He gets continuous phone calls from his mother, which he ignores despite<br> Shalini's insistence to pick them up. However, on returning home, he finds out that his mother had died of a heart attack.<br> Raghuvaran feels guilty about not being there when his mother needed him and develops depression. Meanwhile, Bhuvana's lungs are<br> transplanted into Anitha, a chain smoker who developed lung cancer. Anitha's father Ramkumar is the chairman of a civil<br> engineering company in Chennai and offers Raghuvaran a job as a token of his gratitude for saving his daughter's life.<br> Raghuvaran accepts the job while also requesting Anitha not to smoke, which she agrees. Six months later, Raghuvaran is<br> offered an assignment on a government project to construct high-rise flats to re-house people living in a nearby slum.<br> Azhagusundaram and Manickam are appointed as his assistants. He successfully wins the contract from the government and begins<br> work on it immediately.</h3></pre>  <hr>

           <pre><img src="v4.jfif" style="float:left;"><h3>Arun Subramaniam, a business novice who took over his father's company's Chennai branch, bids for the same contract, even by<br>using illegal methods. Furious that he did not get the land, he tries to thwart Raghuvaran's progress in a number of ways.<br>Raghuvaran overcomes each of these obstacles and continues his work, but Arun eventually hires rowdies to beat up<br> Raghuvaran's workers at the construction site. The workers get injured and end up in hospital, which prompts Raghuvaran to go to<br> Arun's office to put an end to this issue. He makes Arun confess that he sent the rowdies, which is recorded by a micro<br>spy camera, and demands an apology from Arun, blackmailing him that otherwise the video would be made public. Fearing<br>that the video could tarnish his reputation, Arun's father, Venkat, sends his son to the hospital to apologise.<br> Raghuvaran accepts the apology and the project is completed within ten months.<br></pre></p></h3>
